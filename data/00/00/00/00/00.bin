  |   A Duel Hand Disaster: Trackher was created in El Paso, Texas.         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   No cutscenes, just action.                                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   CAPITAL LIST LEADHERBOARDS - The primary goal is to get a high        |
  |   score, however the only way to keep your score is to extract with     |
  |   it. You cannot play till death. If you die, not only do you wipe      |
  |   your current score, you risk the chance of wiping your leaderboard    |
  |   position as well. How you ask? The lower your health the higher the   |
  |   bonus the greater the risk. Every time you extract your score is      |
  |   marked. Why you ask? Why not?                                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   SPLIT SCREEN SINGLE PLAYER TWIN STICK RISK 'EM UP - You will be       |
  |   controlling two ships simultaneously. The devil is in the details.    |
  |   The left side is invincible, however shooting and moving consumes     |
  |   your LINK. In order to restore it you must recover MATERIAL on the    |
  |   right side. MATERIAL multiplies your overall score so use it with     |
  |   absolute discretion. On the right side you are recovering resources   |
  |   and will need 12 PARTS to extract and mark your leaderboard           |
  |   position. Don't doubt yourself. Push yourself. You will be rewarded   |
  |   and you will be tested.                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   TEARS - Each Tear consists of new challenges with hella bonuses       |
  |   attached to them. Focus, overcome, and survive.                       |
  |                                                                         |
